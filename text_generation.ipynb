He was the first to be able, and he was so successful that he became the leader of the world's first robot race.\n","\n","The robot was named \"Prime\" because he had the ability to change the shape of his body. The robot's name was \"The Prime\" and it was known as the Prime Robot. It was also known by the name \"King of Robots\".\n",". Prime was one of many robots that were created by Dr. Robotnik. They were the only ones that could create the robot that was created. However, they were not the most powerful of them. In fact, the robots were so powerful that they could destroy the entire planet. This was because they had a very powerful mind. When Prime created the new robot, he created a giant robot called Prime. After Prime's creation, Prime became a member of a race called the \"Robots of Time\". The robots of time were called \"Time Lords\". They had no powers, but they did have a special ability called Time Manipulation. Time was an ability that allowed them to manipulate the time of their lives. For example, when Prime used his Time Machine to control the Earth, it would cause the earth to spin around and spin faster. If Prime had used Time Control to stop the spinning of Earth's Earth and stop its spinning, then the planet would spin back to its original position.\n"]}]}]}
